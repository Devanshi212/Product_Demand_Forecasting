# Product Demand Forecasting Model

A product demand forecasting system with an ML-based approach to make accurate forecast for thousands of products, based on the previous sales and production 
records. Various deep learning & machine learning algorithms have been implmented to improve the accuracy of the system.  We have used Random Forest, Linear Regression and Moving average algorithms to predict the order demand for previous available data and in doing so, we’ll be able to anticipate demand fluctuations more effectively.
When done right, anticipating demand can assist to tweak your processes to extend potency along the provision chain, as a result of which you’re able
to predict what customers can wish and once they’ll wish it, you will even be able to decrease excess inventory levels, therefore increasing overall gain.
