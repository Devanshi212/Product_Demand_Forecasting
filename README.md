A product demand forecasting system with an ML-based approach to make accurate forecast for thousands of products, based on the previous sales and production 
records. Various deep learning & machine learning algorithms have been implmented to improve the accuracy of the system.  We have used Random Forest, Linear Regression and Moving 
average algorithms to predict the order demand for the previous available data and in 
doing so, you’ll be able to anticipate demand fluctuations more effectively.
When done right, anticipating demand can assist you tweak your processes to 
extend potency right along the provision chain. as a result of you’re higher able
to predict what customers can wish and once they’ll wish it, you will even be able 
to decrease excess inventory levels, therefore increasing overall gain.
